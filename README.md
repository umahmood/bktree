# BK-Tree

An implementation of a [BK-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BK-tree) data
structure in [Go](https://golang.org/). The code adds a dictionary of words
(strings) into a BK-tree. And then allows you to search the tree, to find 
those that are most similar to a given query word.

Note: this is not a library but a full program which can be run using: 

```
$ go run bktree.go
```
